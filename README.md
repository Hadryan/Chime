### Location-based Music Player Android App!

Create some playlists based on the music stored on your phone and assign them to real world locations based in Google Maps. Press 'play' on the main menu to start playing your music! 

Currently when you click on songs in the song selection screen they will play. This was just me testing out the services class and how music playing in general worked for Android. Working on getting group selection of songs and saving to the disk working.

## How to run using Eclipse ADT

Note: This has only been tested with the Android 4.4 SDK.
=========================================================

Open Eclipse, set workspace to Chime, file -> import... -> android -> existing projects into workspace, set the root directory to Chime, click finish, then wait for project to build automatically, run -> run -> android application, NOTE: If you experience difficulties, clean the project first.
