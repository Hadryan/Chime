### Location-based Music Player Android App!

Currently in development. The app queries the songs on the device and you can play songs if you press on the item in the list view. Merging the test branch soon. 

Eventually you will be able to just press 'play' on the main screen and music will start playing based on the user location and pre-set playlists.

## How to run using Eclipse ADT

Note: This has only been tested with the Android 4.4 SDK.
=========================================================

Open Eclipse, set workspace to Chime, file -> import... -> android -> existing projects into workspace, set the root directory to Chime, click finish, then wait for project to build automatically, run -> run -> android application, NOTE: If you experience difficulties, clean the project first.
